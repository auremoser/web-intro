## web-intro
[curriculum] intro to web and html for Parsons: The New School

### description

In this class, we will walk through the fundamentals of web development. We'll take you through various components of the web and how they work together. If you want to learn how to communicate better with your technical team, project partners or friends, this course is for you.

Topics include but are not limited to:

*   What is the World Wide Web?
*   Where are web site files generally stored?
*   What is the difference between a client and a server?
*   Which programming languages are compiled on a server and which are compiled in a web browser?
*   What do you need to know before building a web site?
*   What language should you use and what are the differences?
*   What tools do you need to develop a web site?
*   Who does what on a typical web development team?

This class is for people with little to no technical experience; it will serve as the foundation for more technical curriculum in HTML/CSS and JS.
